			EXPERIENCE
			</h1>
			<h2>First Article Inspection</h2>
			<i>Design Engineer | FEBRUARY, 2016 - JUNE 2017</i>
			The project aims to provide approval to the part produced before going into bulk manufacturing after meeting the customer standards. We need to verify the part number accountability, manufacturing processes, and dimensions of the supplier-manufactured part. If we find any discrepancies need to report back to the supplier for rework or scrap the manufactured part. Based on the type of error, we need to create and maintain engineering release and change documents in ENOVIA PDM. After that, we have to perform PLM actions to update the product information in MBD and 3D Model using CATIA V5 as per the requirement.
			<br/><br/>

			<h2>Manufacturing Work Instructions</h2>
			<i>Senior Design Engineer | JULY, 2017 - AUGUST 2020</i>
			If there are no discrepancies, then the part is approved and moved to the assembly line. We have to prepare assembly line work instructions for the installations as per the provided work order in SAP or MES. For better understanding and easy accessibility to the shop floor people, we use CATIA Composer for creating graphics. The sequence of operations needs to upload into Manufacturing Execution System (MES).
			I have led projects for clients like Bombardier, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Boeing. Given training to more than 20+ associates in various projects.
